\begin{abstract}
We present the evolution UV/optical luminosity function of quasars
from a homogeneous reanalysis of more than 85,000 spectroscopically
selected quasars from redshift $z=0$ to $7.5$.  We derived luminosity
functions when the observed quasar population is binned in luminosity
and redshift, and then construct a continuous evolutionary model of
the luminosity function spanning a range of redshifts.  We find that
quasars selected from the BOSS survey at $z=2$--$3$ show a significant
systematic offset from the general trends, possiblity due to the
colour bias suffered by BOSS.  Some systematic errors also persist in
the lowest-redshift quasar sample due to host galaxy effects. However,
we find that it is possible to describe the luminosity function
evolution from redshift $z=0$ to $7.5$ using a simple 14-parameter
evolving double power law model.  The evolution of the number density
of qsos shows the familiar downsizing effect, although the evolution
in the faint quasar population is quite flat at high redshifts such
that the the drop in their number density at high redshifts is much
slower than that for bright quasars.  When integrated down to
$M_{1450}=-20$ quasars can produce all of the hydrogen-ionizing
photons in the intergalactic medium upto redshifts 3.5.  They fall
short of the emissivity required to explain the Ly$\alpha$ data at
higher redshifts, and are therefore unlikely to have singlehandedly
driven hydrogen reionization.  This conclusion can be altered,
however, if lower luminosity qsos (down to $M_{1450}=-18$) are assumed
to exist and to have a unity escape fraction, in which case qsos can
potentially produce all the hydrogen-ionizing flux at $z<7.5$.
He~\textsc{ii} reionization in this model occurs between $z=3.2$ and
$3.7$.

\section{Introduction}

The luminosity function of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and its
evolution over cosmological time scales has been a matter of central
interest of a large body of work over the last four decades
\citep[e.g.,][]{1978A&A....68...17M, 1983ApJ...269..352S,
  1988ApJ...325...92K, 1988MNRAS.235..935B, 1993ApJ...406L..43H,
  1994ApJ...421..412W, 1995AJ....110...68S, 1995AJ....110.2553K,
  1995ApJ...438..623P, 2000MNRAS.317.1014B, 2001AJ....121...54F,
  2004AJ....128..515F, 2006AJ....131.2766R, 2007ApJ...654..731H,
  2009MNRAS.392...19C, 2010AJ....139..906W, 2011ApJ...728L..26G,
  2013ApJ...773...14R, 2013ApJ...768..105M, 2015AA...578A..83G,
  2015ApJ...798...28K, 2016ApJ...829...33Y, 2016ApJ...833..222J,
  2017MNRAS.466.1160M}.  Determination of the AGN luminosity function
constrains models of the build-up of supermassive black holes
\citep{2015MNRAS.452..575S, 2016MNRAS.462..190R}.  Due to the
incidence of supermassive black holes in most galaxies, the tight
scaling relations observed to exist between the mass of these black
holes and properties of their host galaxies
\citep{2013ARA&A..51..511K, 2013ApJ...764..184M}, and the increasing
consensus that AGN activity feeds back on the host galaxy evolution,
the AGN luminosity function also constrains models of galaxy
formation.  Finally, thanks to their relative brightness and high
Lyman continuum escape fraction, the luminosity function of AGN
determines their influence on the temperature and ionization state of
the intergalactic medium (IGM) over large scales, possibly even
primarily driving hydrogen and helium reionization.

The claimed discovery of 19 low-luminosity ($M_{1450}>-22.6$) AGN
between redshifts $z=4.1$ and $6.3$ by \citet{2015AA...578A..83G}
using a novel X-ray/NIR selection criterion, has renewed the interest
in the evolution of the UV luminosity function of AGN.  This finding
suggested that the faint end of the quasar UV luminosity function is
steeper at these redshifts than previously thought
\citep{2007ApJ...654..731H, 2012ApJ...746..125H}.  Using far-UV
spectral slopes from composite spectra of low-redshift quasars, and
assuming a Lyman continuum escape fraction of 100\%,
\citet{2015AA...578A..83G} argued that AGN brighter than
$M_{1450}=-18$ can potentially produce all of the metagalactic
hydrogen photoionization rate inferred from the \lya forest at
$4<z<6$.  Additional indications of a significant presence of AGN at
high redshift ($z\sim 6$) have emerged.  First,
\citet{2015MNRAS.447.3402B} reported a large scatter in the \lya
opacity between different sightlines close to redshift
$z=6$. \cite{2015MNRAS.453.2943C} showed that these opacity
fluctuations extend to substantially larger scales ($\gtrsim 50\,
h^{-1}$cMpc) than expected in reionization histories dominated by
low-luminosity galaxies (see also \citealt{2016MNRAS.460.1328D}).
\citet{2017MNRAS.465.3429C} further demonstrated that opacity
fluctuations on such large scales arise naturally if there is a
significant contribution ($\gtrsim 50\%$) of AGN to the ionising
emissivity at the redshift of the observed opacity fluctuations ($z
\sim 5.5$--$6$) as would be expected for a QSO luminosity that is
consistent with the measurements of \citet{2015AA...578A..83G}.
Second, measurements of the Lyman continuum escape fraction from
high-redshift galaxies are still elusive.  Although high-redshift
galaxies as faint as rest-frame UV magnitude $M_\mathrm{UV}=-12.5$
($L\sim 10^{-3}L^*$) at $z=6$ \citep{2017ApJ...835..113L} and
redshifts as high as $z=11.1$ \citep{2016ApJ...819..129O} have now
been reported, the escape of Lyman continuum photons has been detected
in only a small number of comparatively bright ($L>0.5L^*$)
low-redshift ($z < 4$) galaxies.  In these galaxies, the escape
fraction is typically found to be 2--20\% \citep{2010ApJ...725.1011V,
  2011ApJ...736...41B, 2015ApJ...804...17S, 2015ApJ...810..107M,
  2016A&A...585A..48G, 2017MNRAS.468..389J, 2017MNRAS.465..316M} but
reionization would require escape fraction of about 20\% in galaxies
down to $M_\mathrm{UV}=-13$ \citep{2016PASA...33...37F,
  2015ApJ...802L..19R, 2016MNRAS.457.4051K}.  Finally, incidence of
high-redshift AGN is also consistent with the shallow bright-end
slopes of the high-redshift ($z\sim 7$) UV luminosity function of
galaxies relative to a Schechter-function representation
\citep{2012MNRAS.426.2772B, 2014MNRAS.440.2810B, 2014ApJ...792...76B,
  2015MNRAS.452.1817B} and the hard spectra of these bright galaxies
\citep{2015MNRAS.450.1846S, 2015MNRAS.454.1393S, 2017MNRAS.464..469S}.

However, these arguements in favour of a higher incidence of
UV-emitting AGN at high redshit, have been contested by several
observations.  \citet{2016arXiv160706467D} considered the effect of
AGN-dominated reionization on the Ly$\alpha$ opacity at $z>5$,
He~\textsc{ii} Ly$\alpha$ opacity at $z\sim 3.1$--$3.3$, and the
thermal history of the IGM.  In agreement with
\citet{2015MNRAS.453.2943C}, these authors found that AGN did provide
a plausible explanation for the large fluctuations in the Ly$\alpha$
opacity at $z>5$.  However, they found that reionization of
He~\textsc{ii} occurs much earlier in these AGN-dominated models (see
also \citealt{2016arXiv160602719M}).  For instance, in the model of
\citet{2015ApJ...813L...8M}, He~\textsc{ii} reionization is complete
at $z=4.5$, compared to $z=3$ in the standard scenario
\citep{2012ApJ...746..125H}.  This early Helium reionization could
result in higher IGM temperatures due to the associated photoheating.
The temperature of the IGM at mean density is enhanced in
AGN-dominated models by factors of $\sim 2$ relative to the standard
models for $z=3.5$--$5$, in conflict with measurements.  This
inconsistency could be avoided by reducing the escape fraction of 4~Ry
photons in AGN, but it is not clear if this can be achieved while
requiring a 100\% escape fraction of 1~Ry photons in order to explain
the Ly$\alpha$ opacity fluctuations.  Further evidence against
AGN-dominated reionization models has emerged from metal-line
absorbers at $z\sim 6$.  In their cosmological radiation
hydrodynamical simulations, \citet{2016MNRAS.459.2299F} find that the
hard spectral slopes of UV backgrounds in AGN-only reionization models
produce too many C~\textsc{iv} absorption systems relative to
Si~\textsc{iv} and C~\textsc{ii} at $z\sim 6$.  However, these
simulations assume an $L_\nu\propto\nu^{-1.57}$ AGN SED at extreme UV
\citep{2001AJ....122..549V, 2002ApJ...579..500T, 2012ApJ...746..125H}.
This slope is marginally harder than recent measurements
($L_\nu\propto\nu^{-1.7}$) from a stack of $z\sim 2.4$ quasars
\citep{2015MNRAS.449.4204L}.  \citet{2016MNRAS.459.2299F} also find
that the N(Si~\textsc{iv})/N(C~\textsc{iv}) column density ratio
measurements prefer a somewhat harder and more intense $>4$~Ry
background than the standard model of \citet{2012ApJ...746..125H}.
Using a large sample of X-ray-selected quasars in the redshift range
$z=0$--$6$, \citet{2017MNRAS.465.1915R} find that the faint end of the
AGN UV luminosity function at $z\sim 6$ is likely to be much shallower
that that reported by \citet{2015AA...578A..83G}.  In their analysis,
\citet{2017MNRAS.465.1915R} use an AGN obscuration optical depth
($\log N_\mathrm{H}$) cut-off that reproduces low-redshift AGN UV
luminosity functions and an X-ray-to-optical/UV luminosity ratio
calibrated at redshifts $z=0.05$--$4$ \citep{2010A&A...512A..34L}.
These authors argue that the apparent contradiction with the results
of \citet{2015AA...578A..83G} could be explained by contamination
from the AGN host galaxies.  It has also been recently argued that the
Lyman continuum escape fraction of AGN might not be 100\% as is
usually assumed \citep{2017MNRAS.465..302M}.  This may further reduce
the contribution of AGN to reionization.

We assume a flat cosmology with density parameters
$\left(\Omega_\mathrm{m},\Omega_\Lambda\right)=\left(0.3,0.7\right)$
and a Hubble constant $H_0=70$\,km\,s$^{-1}$\,Mpc$^{-1}$. Magnitudes
are reported in the AB system \citep{1983ApJ...266..713O}, and
observed magnitudes are point spread function (PSF) magnitudes
\citep{2002AJ....123..485S} corrected for Galactic extinction
\citep{1998ApJ...500..525S} unless otherwise noted.

\section{Homogenised Quasar Sample}

\subsection{Sample Selection}

We started with compiling the samples of recent UV-optical quasar
surveys. The restriction to UV-optical surveys was mainly driven by
our science goal to characterise the UV luminosity function of Type~I
quasars, but also by the still uncertain conversion from X-ray flux to
UV flux, which adds unnecessary systematics for large
samples. \textbf{References!} The individual surveys and their main
characteristics are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:samples}. Figure~\ref{fig:qsos} presents a redshift
histogram of the contributing surveys.

We included surveys based on a set of simple criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Spectroscopic redshifts for the majority of targets.
\item Accurate rest-frame UV-optical CCD photometry.
\item Statistical power (sample size, coverage in $z$ and/or $M_{1450}$).
\item A characterised selection function.
\end{enumerate}
As a prerequisite for a joint analysis of the QLF we obtained the
survey selection functions in electronic form, either from the
publication or from the authors. As a reference for future surveys we
publish them here in modified and homogenised form
(Section~\ref{sect:datahom}). \textbf{Maybe get the authors' consent.}

Due to their selection criteria and their statistical power specific
surveys contribute to distinct redshift ranges. At $z<2.2$ we
considered quasars from the SDSS DR7 quasar catalogue
\citep{2010AJ....139.2360S} and the 2SLAQ catalogue
\citep{2009MNRAS.392...19C}. We restricted the SDSS DR7 sample to XXX
$z<2.2$ quasars selected with the final SDSS quasar selection
algorithm \citep{2002AJ....123.2945R, 2006AJ....131.2766R} from a
survey area of 6248\,deg$^2$ \citep{2012ApJ...746..169S}. We adopted
the SDSS targeting photometry corrected for Galactic extinction
\citep{2010AJ....139.2360S}. To limit systematic uncertainties in the
correction for host galaxy light \citep{2009MNRAS.392...19C} we
restricted the 2SLAQ sample to XXX $g<21.85$ $0.4<z<2.2$ quasars from
its spectroscopic survey footprint near the North Galactic Pole (NGP,
XX quasars in $127.7$\,deg$^2$) and the South Galactic Pole (SGP, XX
quasars in $64.2$\,deg$^2$). The small sample overlap between SDSS and
2SLAQ (112 quasars) has negligible impact on the QLF evaluation.

At $2.2<z<3.5$ we used a single sample of 23,301 uniformly
colour-selected quasars from 2236\,deg$^2$ in BOSS DR9
\citep{2013ApJ...773...14R} due to several improvements compared to
previous surveys. First, it covers a similar magnitude range as 2SLAQ
but with $>20$ times as many quasars. Second, although the SDSS DR7
sample provides better coverage of the bright end of the QLF at these
redshifts, its selection function is highly dependent on the assumed
incidence of (partial) Lyman limit systems in the IGM
\citep{2009ApJ...705L.113P, 2011ApJ...728...23W}. While the BOSS DR9
selection function considers these improvements, the uncertainty in
the QLF remains dominated by assumptions in the selection function
given the large sample size
\citep{2013ApJ...773...14R}. Variability-selected quasar samples
circumvent this issue \citep{2013ApJ...773...14R, 2013A&A...551A..29P,
  2016A&A...587A..41P}, but may be affected by (i) single-epoch
imaging incompleteness at the faint end \citep{2013ApJ...773...14R},
and (ii) uncertainties in the selection function caused by the limited
number of known $z\ga 3$ quasars not selected by variability in the
same footprint \citep{2013A&A...551A..29P, 2016A&A...587A..41P}.

At $3.7<z<4.1$ we used a combination of SDSS DR7 \citep[XX uniformly
  selected quasars from][]{2010AJ....139.2360S} and the NDWFS$+$DLS
survey \citep{2010ApJ...710.1498G,2011ApJ...728L..26G}. The lower cut
$z>3.7$ limits the impact of systematic uncertainties in the
\citet{2006AJ....131.2766R} SDSS selection function
\citep{2009ApJ...705L.113P, 2011ApJ...728...23W}. We did not consider
the results from surveys for faint $z\sim 4$ quasars in the COSMOS
field \citep{2011ApJ...728L..25I, 2012ApJ...755..169M} due to
systematic errors in their selection functions\footnote{Both studies
  simulated quasar colours with a mean IGM attenuation curve
  \citep{1995ApJ...441...18M} that cannot account for stochastic Lyman
  continuum absorption, and therefore underpredicts the variance in
  quasar colours \citep{1999ApJ...518..103B, 2008MNRAS.387.1681I,
    2011ApJ...728...23W}. Modelling the colour variance in these
  surveys is essential, as most of the \citet{2011ApJ...728L..25I}
  quasars are near the edge of their colour selection region (see
  their Figure~1), and \citet{2012ApJ...755..169M} require modest
  attenuation of the $U$ band flux relative to the mid-infrared
  flux.}. Furthermore, 30 per cent of the \citet{2012ApJ...755..169M}
COSMOS sample have visually estimated photometric redshifts, and the
spectroscopic subsample reveals that 40 per cent of the visually
estimated redshifts are biased low
($z_\mathrm{spec}>z_\mathrm{est}+0.3$, see their Figure~9). These
unaccounted systematic redshift errors at least partly explain the
discrepancy in the $z\sim 4$ QLF between \citet{2011ApJ...728L..26G}
and \citet{2012ApJ...755..169M}, which justifies our preference for
the former sample.

Between $z=4.1$ and $z=4.7$ our combined sample has XX uniformly
selected quasars from the SDSS DR7 quasar catalogue
\citep{2010AJ....139.2360S} and XX quasars from
\citet{2011ApJ...728L..26G}. Although we do not include the highly
debated \citet{2015AA...578A..83G} sample in our main analysis due to
its rough selection function and lacking spectroscopy for 17 of the 22
quasar candidates, we use it in Section~XX to constrain the faint end
($M_{1450}>-23$) of the QLF at $z>4.1$. We restricted the
\citet{2015AA...578A..83G} sample to the 19/22 sources considered in
their QLF.

At $4.7\le z<5.1$ we combined several recent surveys, accounting for
sample overlap and updated selection functions. At the bright end of
the QLF we used the 71 $z<5.1$ quasars from the SDSS+WISE survey
\citep{2016ApJ...829...33Y} together with its selection function.
%Although \citet{yang} are sensitive to $z>5.1$ quasars, we limit
%their sample to $z<5.1$ to limit differential evolution of the QLF
%across the redshift range.
To avoid double-counting quasars contained both in
\citet{2016ApJ...829...33Y} and the SDSS DR7 sample from
\citet{2013ApJ...768..105M}, we used the latter only at
$M_{1450}>-26.72$ (in our adopted cosmology), yielding 94 additional
$4.7\le z<5.1$ quasars selected in 6248\,deg$^2$. We used the updated
$z\sim 5$ SDSS DR7 selection function \citep{2013ApJ...768..105M}
instead of the one from \citet{2006AJ....131.2766R}.
%\footnote{We note that the major difference in the selection
%functions must be due to different input parameters, since the single
%color selection criterion in \citet{mcgreer} selects the vast
%majority of the SDSS DR7 quasars.}.
To these two bright-end samples we added the faint-end sample from the
\citet{2013ApJ...768..105M} SDSS Stripe~82 survey (52 uniformly
selected $4.7\le z<5.1$ quasars in 235\,deg$^2$) and two quasars from
\citet{2011ApJ...728L..26G}, adopting the respective selection
functions. We did not consider the limit on the $z\sim 5$ QLF by
\citet{2012ApJ...756..160I} due to systematic errors in their
selection function\footnote{\citet{2012ApJ...756..160I} underestimated
  the dispersion in rest-frame UV quasar colours with respect to SDSS
  at all redshifts (their Figure~4). Contrary to their claim,
  photometric errors have a small effect on the colour distribution of
  SDSS quasars given the statistical errors of $<0.03$\,mag in $gri$
  for 90 per cent of the SDSS DR7 bright quasar sample ($i<19.1$) and
  a relative calibration error of $\sim 1$ per cent
  \citep{2008ApJ...674.1217P}.}.

The SDSS colours of $5.1\le z<5.5$ quasars are similar to those of M
and L dwarf stars, resulting in a low and uncertain selection
efficiency \citep{2013ApJ...768..105M}. WISE mid-infrared selection
performs better \citep{2016ApJ...829...33Y}, but is restricted to the
bright end of the quasar population. Our combined sample contains the
remaining 28 quasars from \citet{2016ApJ...829...33Y} and 10 quasars
from the \citet{2013ApJ...768..105M} Stripe~82 survey. As we will show
in Section~XX, the resulting QLF is consistent with those at lower and
higher redshifts, indicating that the \citet{2013ApJ...768..105M}
selection functions are quite reliable. \textbf{Check this!}

Finally, we combined the samples from all spectroscopic $z\sim 6$
quasar surveys with a determined selection function as of June
2017. \citet{2016ApJ...833..222J} recently compiled all quasars
discovered in several SDSS $z\sim 6$ surveys together with
consistently derived selection functions. Their uniform sample
consists of 24 quasars from the SDSS main survey (11240\,deg$^2$), 10
additional quasars in regions with two or more SDSS imaging scans
(so-called overlap regions, 4223\,deg$^2$), and 13 faint quasars from
SDSS Stripe~82 (277\,deg$^2$). The CFHQS \citep{2010AJ....139..906W}
provided a uniform sample of 16 quasars in the Very Wide Survey
(494\,deg$^2$) and a single quasar in the Deep Survey
($4.47$\,deg$^2$). The one quasar detected in both SDSS and CFHQS does
not lead to underestimated statistical errors in the QLF. Lastly, we
included the two objects from \citet{2015ApJ...798...28K}. One might
be a Lyman break galaxy due to its narrow Ly$\alpha$ emission line
(half width at half maximum 427\,km\,s$^{-1}$), but
\citet{2015ApJ...798...28K} note that 10/17 candidates do not have
follow-up spectroscopy, hence their QLF may be underestimated. Since
very small samples preclude a statistical correction via the selection
function, complete spectroscopic follow-up of $z\sim 6$ candidates is
essential. Although we will account for the slightly different
redshift sensitivities for the different surveys, we will quote a
nominal redshift range $5.7<z<6.5$ for the combined $z\sim 6$ sample.

\subsection{Sample Homogenisation}
\label{sect:datahom}

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{kcorr.pdf}
  \caption{Bandpass corrections $K_{m,1450}$ from a broadband magnitude $m=\{g,i,z_\mathrm{AB}\}$
           to the monochromatic AB magnitude at 1450\,\AA\ as a function of redshift $z$ for the \citet{2015MNRAS.449.4204L}
           quasar SED used in this work, and for two quasar composite spectra \citep{2001AJ....122..549V, 2002ApJ...565..773T}.
           The redshift range has been restricted to exclude the Ly$\alpha$ forest and to account for the different
           rest frame wavelength coverage of the spectra.}
  \label{fig:kcorr}
\end{figure}

For a joint fit of the QLF it is necessary to homogenise the different
survey samples in absolute magnitude, and to convert their selection
functions to the same absolute magnitude system. For the analysis of
the quasar UV emissivity and to be consistent with published work at
$z>3$ we chose to convert all samples and selection functions to the
absolute AB magnitude at a rest frame wavelength $\lambda=1450$\,\AA
\begin{equation}\label{eq:absmag}
M_{1450}\left(z\right) = m-5\log{\left(\frac{d_L\left(z\right)}{\mathrm{Mpc}}\right)}-25-K_{m,1450}\left(z\right),
\end{equation}
with the luminosity distance $d_L\left(z\right)$ to a quasar at
redshift $z$, the apparent magnitude $m$ in a filter used in the
survey, and the bandpass correction $K_{m,1450}\left(z\right)$
\citep{1956AJ.....61...97H, 1968ApJ...154...21O, 2000A&A...353..861W,
  2002astro.ph.10394H}. For the bandpass correction we used a
combination of the \citet{2015MNRAS.449.4204L} quasar SED at
$\lambda<2500$\,\AA, and the \citet{2001AJ....122..549V} quasar
composite spectrum at longer wavelengths to cover the lowest
redshifts.  The samples from SDSS and BOSS are defined in the SDSS $i$
band, while 2SLAQ is defined in the $g$ band. At $z>4.7$ we adopted
the SDSS $z$ band magnitude (in the following denoted $z_\mathrm{AB}$)
for SDSS DR7 quasars to avoid additional corrections due to the
Ly$\alpha$ forest. Figure~\ref{fig:kcorr} shows our bandpass
corrections for SDSS, BOSS and 2SLAQ as a function of redshift. We
ignored the luminosity dependence of the bandpass correction due to
the known anticorrelation of emission line equivalent width and
luminosity \citep{1977ApJ...214..679B}.  While the
\citet{2015MNRAS.449.4204L} SED is for luminous ($M_{1450}\simeq
-27.2$) quasars, UV composite spectra including fainter quasars
\citep{2002ApJ...565..773T, 2012ApJ...752..162S, 2014ApJ...794...75S}
give similar values, such that our bandpass corrections remain
applicable at $M_{1450}\la -24$. Empirical luminosity-dependent
bandpass corrections show a $\la 0.2$\,mag variation over $\sim 4$
orders of absolute magnitude depending on redshift and the filter, and
with a $\sim 0.2$\,mag intrinsic scatter due to individual SED
variations \citep{2013ApJ...773...14R, 2013ApJ...768..105M,
  2013A&A...551A..29P}.

For the $z<2.2$ sample we corrected the SDSS $i$ and 2SLAQ $g$ band
magnitudes for host galaxy contamination following
\citet{2009MNRAS.392...19C}. Considering the different magnitude
limits of 2SLAQ and SDSS, the modelled host galaxy contamination is
small for $z>0.5$ quasars ($<0.1$\,mag in $g$, $<0.2$\,mag in $i$),
and is negligible at $z>0.8$.  In case the band defining the magnitude
limit of the survey undesirably overlaps with the Ly$\alpha$ forest
\citep{2010ApJ...710.1498G, 2011ApJ...728L..26G, 2013ApJ...768..105M}
we adopted their respective bandpass corrections to $M_{1450}$. In
particular, for the \citet{2010ApJ...710.1498G, 2011ApJ...728L..26G}
sample we recomputed $M_{1450}$ from the $R$ band photometry to be
consistent with the selection function defined in $R$, and to avoid
uncertainties in their spectrophotometry due to incomplete spectral
coverage. Since the \citet{2010ApJ...710.1498G, 2011ApJ...728L..26G}
$R$ band traces the rest frame UV, we assumed negligible host galaxy
contamination for their faint quasars. For the remaining high-redshift
surveys reporting $M_{1450}$ obtained by various methods
\citep{2010AJ....139..906W, 2015ApJ...798...28K, 2015AA...578A..83G,
  2016ApJ...829...33Y, 2016ApJ...833..222J} we did not re-compute
$M_{1450}$, but applied appropriate shifts to correct to our adopted
cosmology.

The selection functions were treated similarly, i.e.\ the photometric
selection function of survey $j$ given in observed magnitudes
$f_{\mathrm{p},j}\left(m,z\right)$ \citep{2006AJ....131.2766R,
  2009MNRAS.392...19C, 2010ApJ...710.1498G, 2013ApJ...773...14R} was
transformed to our absolute magnitudes
$f_{\mathrm{p},j}\left(M_{1450},z\right)$ with
Equation~\ref{eq:absmag}, while the ones given in $M_{1450}$ were
adjusted to our cosmology. Note, however, that many surveys report
additional sources of incompleteness that preclude a straightforward
re-evaluation of the QLF.

For 2SLAQ we corrected for magnitude-dependent spectroscopic coverage
in the two survey areas \citep[$f_\mathrm{c,NGP}\left(g\right)$ and
  $f_\mathrm{c,SGP}\left(g\right)$; Figure~4
  in][]{2009MNRAS.392...19C} and spectroscopic redshift success
\citep[$f_\mathrm{s,2SLAQ}\left(g\right)$; Figure~6b
  in][]{2009MNRAS.392...19C} by multiplying them with the photometric
selection function, resulting in two area-specific 2SLAQ selection
functions
$f_\mathrm{NGP}\left(M_{1450},z\right)=f_\mathrm{p,2SLAQ}f_\mathrm{c,NGP}f_\mathrm{s,2SLAQ}$
and
$f_\mathrm{SGP}\left(M_{1450},z\right)=f_\mathrm{p,2SLAQ}f_\mathrm{c,SGP}f_\mathrm{s,2SLAQ}$
that are relevant for the QLF.  The $z<4.7$ SDSS photometric selection
function was modified to include known imaging incompleteness to
$f_{\mathrm{SDSS},z<4.7}=0.95f_{\mathrm{p,SDSS},z<4.7}$
\citep{2006AJ....131.2766R}. The BOSS colour-selected sample contains
quasars with $f_\mathrm{c,BOSS}f_\mathrm{s,BOSS}\ge 0.85$
\citep{2013ApJ...773...14R}, and we adopted
$f_\mathrm{BOSS}=\overline{f_\mathrm{c,BOSS}f_\mathrm{s,BOSS}}f_\mathrm{p,BOSS}=0.962f_\mathrm{p,BOSS}$. \citet{2010ApJ...710.1498G}
presented two area-specific photometric selection functions due to
different filters employed, and more follow-up spectroscopy was
reported in \citet{2011ApJ...728L..26G}. We accounted for remaining
spectroscopic incompleteness at $R>23$, yielding the final selection
functions $f_\mathrm{NDWFS}$ and $f_\mathrm{DLS}$. The updated $z\sim
5$ SDSS photometric selection function \citep{2013ApJ...768..105M} was
modified to include imaging and spectroscopic incompleteness, yielding
$f_{\mathrm{SDSS},z\sim 5}=0.95^2f_{\mathrm{p,SDSS},z\sim 5}$. In the
deeper $z\sim 5$ SDSS Stripe~82 survey the spectroscopic
incompleteness is larger and magnitude-dependent \citep[Figure~14
  in][]{2013ApJ...768..105M}, resulting in $f_{\mathrm{S82},z\sim
  5}=0.95f_{\mathrm{s,S82},z\sim
  5}\left(i\right)f_{\mathrm{p,S82},z\sim 5}$. Likewise, imaging and
magnitude-dependent spectroscopic incompleteness was factored into the
\citet{2016ApJ...829...33Y} photometric selection function (their
Figures~5 and 7), resulting in
$f_\mathrm{SDSS+WISE}=0.97f_\mathrm{s,SDSS+WISE}\left(z_\mathrm{AB}\right)f_\mathrm{p,SDSS+WISE}$. Finally,
we obtained a rough estimate of the \citet{2015AA...578A..83G}
selection function by comparing the corrected and observed QLFs,
i.e.\ taking $f_\mathrm{GOODS-S}=\phi_\mathrm{obs}/\phi_\mathrm{corr}$
(see their Table~3).

\section{Luminosity function}

Given quasar luminosities and estimates for survey completeness, we
begin our analysis by first deriving luminosity functions binned both
in redshift and magnitude.  In this discussion all magnitudes are
absolute magnitudes at rest-frame 1450~{\AA}.

% Put that sentence about magnitudes in the introduction.

\subsection{Binned luminosity function estimates}

In a magnitude bin $[M_\mathrm{min}, M_\mathrm{max})$, and redshift
  bin $[z_\mathrm{min}, z_\mathrm{max})$, we define the luminosity
    function as \citep{2000MNRAS.311..433P}
  \begin{equation}
    \phi \equiv \frac{N}{V_\mathrm{bin}},
  \end{equation}
  where $N$ is the number of quasars with magnitude
  $M_\mathrm{min}\leq M<M_\mathrm{max}$ and redshift
  $z_\mathrm{min}\leq z<z_\mathrm{max}$, and
  \begin{equation}
    V_\mathrm{bin} = \int_{M_\mathrm{min}}^{M_\mathrm{max}}dM\int_{z_\mathrm{min}}^{z_\mathrm{max}}dz\, f(M, z)\,\frac{dV}{dz},
    \label{eqn:vi}
  \end{equation}
  is the effective volume of the bin.  Here $f(M,z)$ is the quasar
  selection probability, which includes incompleteness.  Inclusion of
  the selection probability in Equation~(\ref{eqn:vi}) accounts for
  what are sometimes called ``incomplete bins''
  \citep{2006AJ....131.2766R}.  The comoving volume element $dV/dz$ is
  given by
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{dV}{dz}=\frac{dV}{dz\,d\Omega}\cdot A\cdot\frac{4\pi}{41253},
  \end{equation}
  where $A$ is the survey area in deg$^2$, and 
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{dV}{dz\,d\Omega}=\frac{c}{H_0}\frac{d_L(z)^2}{(1+z)^2\sqrt{\Omega_m(1+z)^3+\Omega_\Lambda}},
    \label{eqn:dvdzdo}
  \end{equation}
  denotes the comoving volume element per unit solid angle
  \citep{1999astro.ph..5116H}.  The luminosity distance $d_L$ is given
  by
  \begin{equation}
    d_L(z)=(1+z)\frac{c}{H_0}\int_0^z\frac{dz}{\sqrt{\Omega_m(1+z)^3+\Omega_\Lambda}}.
    \label{eqn:dl}
  \end{equation}
  Equations~(\ref{eqn:dvdzdo}) and (\ref{eqn:dl}) assume a flat
  Universe ($\Omega_k=0$).  The luminosity function $\phi$ has units
  of $\mathrm{cMpc}^{-3}\mathrm{mag}^{-1}$.  We evaluate the double
  integral in Equation~(\ref{eqn:vi}) by the Euler method, i.e., by
  simply summing over the ``tiles'' of the selection function map,
  without interpolating between the redshift and luminosity values of
  neighbouring tiles.  This may result in $V_i=0$ for some quasars, in
  which case we remove them from our analysis.

  In each bin, we estimate the uncertainty in the luminosity function
  by assuming Poisson statistics \citep{1986ApJ...303..336G}.  The
  resultant binned luminosity function estimates are shown by the
  points in Figure~\ref{fig:mosaic}.  These agree quite well with the
  published luminosity functions by these surveys.

  % Do we want to give the details of how good/bad this agreement
  % actually is?
  
  %% Figure~\ref{fig:boss}
  %% shows the luminosity function derived in this way for the BOSS DR9
  %% colour-selected sample of 23,301 quasars, in comparison with the
  %% published luminosity function of \citet{2013ApJ...773...14R}.
  %% Figure~\ref{fig:sdss} shows the luminosity function of a sample of

\subsection{Luminosity function estimates in redshift bins}
\label{sec:bins}

As our next step, we stop binning the quasars in luminosity, and only
bin them in redshifts.  In each redshift bin, we model the quasar
luminosity function as a double power law given by
\citep{1988MNRAS.235..935B, 1995ApJ...438..623P, 2000MNRAS.317.1014B}
\begin{equation}
  \phi(M) =
  \frac{\phi_*}{10^{0.4(\alpha+1)(M-M_*)}+10^{0.4(\beta+1)(M-M_*)}}.
  \label{eqn:dpl}
\end{equation}
Equation~(\ref{eqn:dpl}) has four free parameters: the amplitude
$\phi_*$, the ``break'' $M_*$, the faint-end slope $\beta$, and the
bright-end slope $\alpha$.  We obtain posterior probability
distributions for these parameters using MCMC \citep[e.g.,][]{jaynes}.
The joint posterior probability distribution of the model parameters
is then written as
\begin{multline}
  p(\phi_*, M_*, \alpha, \beta | \{M_i, z_i\}) \propto \\ p(\phi_*, M_*, \alpha, \beta)p(\{M_i, z_i\} | \phi_*, M_*, \alpha, \beta),
\end{multline}
where the constant of proportionality is independent of the luminosity
function parameters, and $\{M_i, z_i\}$ denotes the magnitudes and
redshifts of quasars falling in a redshift bin $[z_\mathrm{min},
  z_\mathrm{max})$.  We use a uniform prior distribution $p(\phi_*,
  M_*, \alpha, \beta)$ and assume that the likelihood
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}\equiv p(\{M_i, z_i\} | \phi_*, M_*, \alpha, \beta)
\end{equation}
is given by $\phi(M)$ with suitable normalisation.  The negative
logarithm of the likelihood $S\equiv -2\ln\mathcal{L}$ can then be
written as
\begin{multline}
  S = -2\sum_{i=1}^N\ln\phi(M_i, z_i)\\+2\int_{M_\mathrm{min}}^{M_\mathrm{max}}dM\int_{z_\mathrm{min}}^{z_\mathrm{max}}dz\, \phi(M,z) f(M, z)\,\frac{dV}{dz}.
  \label{eqn:S}
\end{multline}
where $N$ is the total number of quasars in the redshift bin and the
luminosity integral in the second term on the right hand side is on
the surveyed range of $M$.

The above likelihood can also be understood as the limit of the
Poisson likelihood in luminosity and redshift bins
\citep{1983ApJ...269...35M, 2001AJ....121...54F}.  We can write the
probability of observing $n_{ij}$ quasars in the $(M_i, z_j)$ bin as
the Poisson distribution
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}=\prod_{i,j}\frac{e^{-\mu_{ij}}\mu_{ij}^{n_{ij}}}{n_{ij}!},
  \label{eqn:lhood}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
  \mu_{ij}= \int_{M_i}^{M_{i+1}}dM\int_{z_j}^{z_{j+1}}dz\, \phi(M,z) f(M, z)\,\frac{dV}{dz},
\end{equation}
is the average number of quasars expected in the $(M_i, z_j)$ bin
given the luminosity function $\phi(M,z)$.  In the limit of
infinitesimal bins, $n_{ij}=0$ or $1$, Equation~(\ref{eqn:lhood}) can
be simplified and we get Equation~(\ref{eqn:S}).

Our estimates for the luminosity function in several redshift bins are
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mosaic}.  The median of the posterior is
shown as the best fit model.  Yellow curves show a random draw from
the posterior.  Consistent with previous studies, the double power law
model provides an excellent description of the luminosity function
model over almost the complete range of redshifts spanned by the data.
It is only in the highest redshift bin ($z=5.5$--$6.5$) that the data
seem to favour a single power law.  In this bin, we the resultant
posterior distribution of the break magnitude $M_*$ is bimodal with
favoured values at the faint ($M_*>-18$) and bright end of the data
($M_*<-30$).  We consider only the latter possibility as consistent
with the data at lower redshifts ($z<5.5$).  In light of the low
redshift data, we use restricted priors in this redshift bins: we
restrict the bright-end slope $\alpha$ to values less than $-4$.
Other paramters continue to have wide uniform priors.

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:mosaic}, in several redshift bins the
binned quasar luminosity function seems to show a decline at the faint
end.  This is clearly seen, for example, in the 2SLAQ sample at $z<2$.
We take this to be a systematic error: the decrease in the luminosity
function is an indication of incompleteness in the quasar surveys that
has not been accounted for by the reported completeness map.  We
choose to discard such quasars from our analysis.  This behaviour is
also seen in the SDSS quasar sample at $z<1.8$ and $z\sim 4$.  The
discarded luminosity bins are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mosaic} by open
circles.  We can see that the surviving quasar sample is in excellent
agreement with the double power law model at all redshifts.

The values of the four double power law parameters in various redshift
bins are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:evoln}.  We find interesting
evolutionary trends in each of the four parameters.  The break
luminosity $M_*$ evolves by more than eight magnitudes from redshift
$z=0$ to $7$.  The amplitude of the luminosity function $\phi_*$
evolves moderately from $z=0$ to $z\sim 3$ and then drops by six
orders of magnitude to about $10^{-12}$ at $z\sim 7$.  The bright end
slope $\alpha$ has significant scatter, but still shows a trend
towards larger negative values---that is, steeper bright-end
luminosity functions---at high redshifts.  Finally, the faint end of
the luminosity function also shows signs of increasing steepness
towards high redshifts.  Somewhat similar to the amplitude $\phi_*$,
the faint-end slope $\beta$ also shows a break at $z\sim 3$.  It stays
roughly constant up to this redshift, and the drops to increasingly
negative values at high redshifts, indicating a steeper faint end.

The behaviour of BOSS quasars in Figure~\ref{fig:evoln} is striking.
In the redshift range covered by BOSS the values of the four double
power law parameters deviate from the general trends.  The faint end
of the luminosity function of the BOSS quasars is much shallower and
the break luminosity is fainter by a magnitude.  The bright end of the
luminosity function of quasars in this sample is also much flatter
than that for other samples.  The conspicuousness of the deviation of
the BOSS sample from the general trends makes it unlikely that the
luminosity function evolution indicated by BOSS in the redshift range
$z=2$--$3$ is physical.  Indeed, in this redshift range BOSS quasar
selection is known to be affected by a colour bias
\citep{2011ApJ...728...23W}, as the quasar colour selection is
contaminated by a population of blue stars.  We therefore deem the
BOSS sample as affected by this systematic error.

The open circles in Figure~\ref{fig:evoln} show the results of a
similar analysis of the quasar UV luminosity function by
\citep{2017MNRAS.466.1160M}.  Evidently, our results are quite
different from the results of these authors.  While their analysis
generally also reveals a steep faint end slop, the break luminosity
evolution is dramatically different.  In their analysis the break
luminosity tends to remain roughly constant $M_*\sim -24$ from $z=0$
to $7$, but this does not seem to be indicated by the data shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:mosaic}.  A possible reason behind their significanly
different results could be a bias introduced by binning in
luminosities and redshifts while fitting the luminosity function model.

\subsection{Luminosity function estimate without binning}

The smooth evolution of the luminosity function parameters apparant in
Figure~\ref{fig:evoln} suggests that it should be possible to describe
the quasar UV luminosity function evolution from $z\sim 7$ to $0$
using far fewer number of parameters.  Such descriptions have been put
forward in the literature for the X-ray and bolometric luminosity
functions \citep[e.g.,][]{2007ApJ...654..731H, 2015MNRAS.451.1892A}.
Such ``global'' descriptions of the luminosity function evolution are
useful as they give a continuous description of the luminosity
function.  This makes them valuable while developing an understanding
of the physics behind the luminosity function. We therefore obtain
estimates of the luminosity function in which the evolution of the
four parameters of the double power law models in
Equation~(\ref{eqn:dpl}) is parameterised to write
\begin{align}
  &\phi_*(z) = f_0(\{c_{0,i}\}, z)\nonumber\\
  &M_*(z) = f_1(\{c_{1,i}\}, z)\nonumber\\
  &\alpha(z) = f_2(\{c_{2,i}\}, z)\nonumber\\
  &\beta(z) = f_3(\{c_{3,i}\}, z),
\label{eqn:global}
\end{align}
where the $c_i$'s are the new model parameters.  The joint posterior
probability distribution of these parameters can be now written as
\begin{equation}
  p(\{c_i\} | \{M_i, z_i\}) \propto p(\{c_i\})p(\{M_i, z_i\} | \{c_i\}),
\end{equation}
where the likelihood 
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}\equiv p(\{M_i, z_i\} | \{c_i\}),
\end{equation}
is now given by $\phi(M,z)$ with suitable normalisation.  Note that
$\phi(M,z)$ is simply 
\begin{multline}
  \phi(M,z) = \phi_*(z) \left[10^{0.4(\alpha(z)+1)(M-M_*(z))}\right. \\ \left.+ 10^{0.4(\beta(z)+1)(M-M_*(z))}\right]^{-1}.
\end{multline}
The ngative logarithm of the likelihood $S\equiv -2\ln\mathcal{L}$ is
straightforward generalisation of Equation~(\ref{eqn:S}), so that
\begin{multline}
  S = -2\sum_{i=1}^N\ln\phi(M_i, z_i)\\+2\int_{M_\mathrm{min}}^{M_\mathrm{max}}dM\int_{z_\mathrm{min}}^{z_\mathrm{max}}dz\, \phi(M,z) f(M, z)\,\frac{dV}{dz},
  \label{eqn:S2}
\end{multline}
where now $N$ is the total number of quasars included in the analysis,
and the integrals in the second term on the right-hand side are over
the complete surveyed range of luminosity and redshift.

We consider models in which the evolution of the four double power law
parameter is modelled independently as in
Equations~(\ref{eqn:global}).  This approach has been termed as
``flexible double power law'' by \citet{2015MNRAS.451.1892A}.  For the
parameters $\phi_*$, $M_*$ and $\alpha$ we assume that the functions
$f_i$s in Equations~(\ref{eqn:global}) are Chebyshev polynomials in
$1+z$.  Thus the functions $f_i$s are written as
\begin{equation}
  f_i=\sum_{j=0}^{n_i}c_{i,j}T_j(1+z),
  \label{eqn:cbs}
\end{equation}
where $c_{i,j}$ are the parameters that appear in
Equations~(\ref{eqn:global}) and $T_j(1+z)$ are Chebyshev polynomials
of the first kind.  We try successively higher orders of Chebyshev
polynomials in order to arrive at a good fit with the data.  We find
that $\phi_*$, $M_*$ and $\alpha$ prefer quadratic, cubic, and linear
evolutions in $1+z$.

The faint-end slope $\beta$ seems to require a break in its evolution
at $z\sim 3$, as discussed in the previous section.  As a result, it
is difficult to model the evolution of $\beta$ using the Chebyshev
expansion of Equation~(\ref{eqn:cbs}).  Instead, we consider a double
power law model for $\beta$ and write
\begin{equation}
  f_3(1+z)=h+\frac{f_0}{10^{a\zeta}+10^{b\zeta}},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \zeta = \log_{10}\left(\frac{1+z}{1+z_0}\right),
\end{equation}
thus resulting in a five-parameter model with parameters $h$, $f_0$,
$z_0$, $a$ and $b$.  The parameters $a$ and $b$ thus determine the low
and high redshift slopes of this evolution, with a break at redshift
$z_0$.  This is similar to the model of \citet{2007ApJ...654..731H},
who also favoured a broken power law model for the evolution of the
faint-end slope of the bolometric luminosity function of quasars.

Our resultant 14-parameter global model for the luminosity function
evolution in shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mosaic_global}, in which the
green curves show a random draw from the posterior probability
distibution function.  For comparison, the symbols show the luminosity
function binned in luminosity and redshift, and the yellow curves show
the posterior distribution of the double power law luminosity
functions in various redshift bins, as in Figure~\ref{fig:mosaic}.  We
find that the global model is in excellent agreement with the binned
models.  The agreement is poor for the BOSS quasars as these are not
described by the global model, as discussed in the previous section.

Figure~\ref{fig:evoln_global} shows the parameter evolution in the
global model, by comparing it with the results from the fits in
individual redshift bins shown in Figure~\ref{fig:evoln}.  The
agreement between the two models is very good, showing an evolution
towards a steep faint-end slope of the luminosity function at high
redshifts, a rapid brightening of the break luminosity.  Note that the
redshift bins with BOSS qsos are not shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:evoln_global}, which explains the difference from
Figure~\ref{fig:evoln}.

The evolution of the comoving number density of quasars is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:rhoqso} when the luminosity function is integrated
down to different limits.  Similar to Figure~\ref{fig:evoln_global},
symbols show the best fit parameters with 68\% uncertainties from the
double power law fits to the data in redshift bins.  Black solid curve
shows the best fit global model, and the coloured curves show a random
sample drawn from the global posterior.  Bins with BOSS qsos are not
shown.  The number density of qsos down to the limit of spectroscopic
data is about 1 per $10^5$ cMpc$^3$ at its peak.  This density rapidly
increases at low redshifts and then drops gradually at high redshifts.
Figure~\ref{fig:rhoqso} also shows the familiar downsizing feature in
which the number density of faint qsos peaks are lower redshifts than
that of the bright qsos.  While the number density of qsos with
$M_*<-27$ peaks at $z\sim 2.5$, the number density of qsos with
$M_*<-24$ peaks at $z\sim 2$.  At the faintest luminosity at which
spectroscopic data exist, $M_*<-21$, the number density of qsos peaks
at $z\sim 1$.

\section{Hydrogen photoionization rate}

We can now calculate the contribution of quasars to the hydrogen
photoionization rate in the intergalactic medium (IGM).  We assume
that all quasars have a universal UV SED, parameterised by
\citet{2015MNRAS.449.4204L} as a power law with a break at 912~{\AA},
\begin{equation}
f_\nu\propto\begin{cases}
               \nu^{-0.61\pm 0.01} & \text{if}~\lambda\geq 912~\text{\AA},\\
               \nu^{-1.70\pm 0.61} & \text{if}~600~\text{\AA}<\lambda<912~\text{\AA}.\\                
               \end{cases}
\label{eqn:sed}
\end{equation}
This fit was derived by \citet{2015MNRAS.449.4204L} from a composite
spectrum of 53 quasars at $z\sim 2.4$.

While four published composite quasar UV SEDs
\citep{2002ApJ...565..773T, 2001AJ....122..549V, 2012ApJ...752..162S,
  2014ApJ...794...75S} agree with Equation~(\ref{eqn:sed}), the
composite of \citet{2004ApJ...615..135S}, which uses more than 100
quasars at $z<0.1$, is somewhat steeper, with a EUV slope of $-0.56$.
The quasars considered by \citet{2004ApJ...615..135S} are fainter
($M_i(z=2)>-26$) than those considered by \citet{2015MNRAS.449.4204L},
which suggest that faint quasars may have a steeper EUV spectrum.  We
therefore also consider an SED of the form
\begin{equation}
f_\nu\propto\begin{cases}
               \nu^{-0.61\pm 0.01} & \text{if}~\lambda\geq 912~\text{\AA},\\
               \nu^{-0.56\pm 0.61} & \text{if}~600~\text{\AA}<\lambda<912~\text{\AA}.\\                
               \end{cases}
\label{eqn:sed_faint}
\end{equation}
for qsos with $M_{1450}<-23$.

The rate of emission of photons of frequency $\nu$ by quasars can be
written as
\begin{equation}
\dot n_\nu = \int dM_\nu \phi(M_\nu) \frac{L_\nu(M_\nu)}{h\nu}.
\end{equation}
Here the integral is over a suitable range of magnitudes, the
monochromatic luminosity $L_\nu(M)$ is related to the (absolute AB)
magnitude by \citep{1983ApJ...266..713O}
\begin{equation}
M_\nu = -2.5\log_{10}L_\nu+51.60,
\end{equation}
and $\phi$ is the luminosity function from Equation~(\ref{eqn:dpl}).
The luminosity at 1~Ry is related to that at 1450~\AA\ by
Equation~(\ref{eqn:sed}) or (\ref{eqn:sed_faint})
\begin{equation}
  L_{912}=L_{1450}\left(\frac{\nu_{912}}{\nu_{1450}}\right)^{-0.61}=L_{1450}\left(\frac{912}{1450}\right)^{0.61},
\end{equation}
depending on the qso luminosity.  The corresponding physical volume
emissivity is 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_\nu = \dot n_\nu h\nu (1+z)^3.
\label{eqn:epsilon}
\end{equation}
Figure~\ref{fig:e912} shows the resultant 1~Ry emissivity when the
luminosity function is integrated down to $M_{1450}=-20$ (right panel)
and when it is integrated down to $M_{1450}=-18$ (left panel).
Similar to the previous figures, the black open circles in this figure
show the result form individual redshift bins, while the black curve
shown the result from best-fit global model.  Yellow curves show a
random sample from the global posterior distribution.  For comparison,
various other published determinations of the 1~Ry emissivity of
quasars are also shown in both panels of Figure~\ref{fig:e912}.  The
blue curve in these panels shows the AGN 1~Ry emissivity model of
\citet{2012ApJ...746..125H}, which is very similar to the model of
\citet{2007ApJ...654..731H}.  The red symbols with error bars show the
determination from the fits of \citet{2015AA...578A..83G}.  The maroon
curve is the published fit to the 1~Ry emissivity evolution in the
fits of \citet{2017MNRAS.466.1160M}.  The green curve is the model of
\citet{2015ApJ...813L...8M}.  Note that the integration limits for
these other models are not homogeneous.  \citet{2017MNRAS.466.1160M}
integrate the luminosity function down to $M_{1450}=-19$, while
\citet{2015AA...578A..83G} integrate down to $M_{1450}=-18$.
\textbf{[What are the limits for HM12 and MH15?]}

The 1~Ry emissivity increases rapidly from $z=0$ up to $z=2$ and then
stays roughly constant until up to $z=3.5$.  At higher redshifts, due
to the relatively steeper faint end slope of the luminosity function,
the integration limit makes a large difference in the resultant
emissivity.  For the conservative case, in which we integrate under
the luminosity function down to $M_{1450}=-20$, the emissivity drops
rapidly at $z>3.5$, and is only about 10--20\% higher than that in the
\citet{2012ApJ...746..125H} model at $z\sim 6$.  However, in the model
in which we integrate down to $M_{1450}=-18$, the emissivity is higher
by a factor of almost 10 than that in the \citet{2012ApJ...746..125H}
model at $z\sim 6$.  In this case, our derived emissivities are
consistent with the values published by \citet{2015AA...578A..83G} at
$z=4$--$6$, although they still fall short by a factor of $\sim 2$.
Our derived emissivities are significantly smaller at $z>3.5$ than the
model of \citet{2015ApJ...813L...8M}.

  \label{fig:gammapi}
\end{figure*}

The 1~Ry emissivity can now be used to calculate the ionizing flux and
photoionization rate contributed by quasars.  The frequency dependence
above 1~Ry is given by Equation~(\ref{eqn:sed}) or
(\ref{eqn:sed_faint}), so that for $\nu > \nu_{912}$
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon_\nu = \epsilon_{912}\left(\frac{\nu}{\nu_{912}}\right)^\alpha,
  \label{eqn:epsilon_freq}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha=-1.70$ (Equation~\ref{eqn:sed}) or $-0.56$
(Equation~\ref{eqn:sed_faint}).  The flux in the IGM is
written as a solution of the cosmological radiative transfer equation
as \citep{2012ApJ...746..125H}
\begin{multline}
  j(\nu_0, z_0)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{z_0}^\infty dz\frac{dl}{dz}\frac{(1+z_0)^3}{(1+z)^3}\epsilon(\nu,z)\\
  \times\exp{(-\tau_\mathrm{eff}(\nu_0, z_0, z))},
  \label{eqn:flux}
\end{multline}
where
\begin{equation}
  \nu = \nu_0\left(\frac{1+z}{1+z_0}\right).
\end{equation}
Here the effective optical depth is estimated as
\begin{equation}
  \tau_\mathrm{eff}(\nu_0, z_0, z) = \int_{z_0}^z dz^\prime\int_0^\infty dN_\mathrm{HI} f(N_\mathrm{HI}, z^\prime) (1-e^{-\tau_\nu}),
\end{equation}
where $\tau_\nu=\sigma_\nu N_\mathrm{HI}$ and the column density
distribution $f(N_\mathrm{HI}, z)$ is taken to be a power law \citep{2013MNRAS.436.1023B}
\begin{equation}
  f(N_\mathrm{HI}, z) = \frac{A}{N_\mathrm{LL}}\left(\frac{N_\mathrm{HI}}{N_\mathrm{LL}}\right)^{-\beta_N}\left(\frac{1+z}{4.5}\right)^{-\beta_z},
\end{equation}
with $A=0.93$, $\beta_N=1.33$, $\beta_z=1.92$, and
$N_\mathrm{LL}=10^{17.2}$~cm$^{-2}$.  The hydrogen photoionization
rate is then given by
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma_\mathrm{HI}=4\pi\int_{\nu_{912}}^\infty d\nu \frac{j(\nu,z)}{h\nu} \sigma(\nu),
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the photoionization cross-section.  The result is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gammapi}, in which as before the solid black
curve shows the hydrogen photoionisate rate in our best-fit global
model, and the yellow curves show a random sample from the global
posterior.  Also, as before, the right panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:gammapi} shows the result when we only account for
quasars brighter than $M_{1450}=-20$, while the left panel shows the
result when the integration limit is $M_{1450}=-18$.  The red points
with error bars in this figure show the measurements of
\citet{2013MNRAS.436.1023B}, derived from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest,
and the orange points show the measurements by
\citet{2011MNRAS.412.2543C} from quasar proximity zones.  The dashed
green curve shows the hydrogen photoionisation rate evolution in the
model of \citet{2012ApJ...746..125H}, while the solid green curve
shows the contribution of quasars to it.

The black open circles show the photoionisation rate values derived
from our fits in the individual redshift bins.  However, note that
unlike in the global model it is not possible to do the integral in
Equation~(\ref{eqn:flux}) for these individual fits.  We can only
derive the photoionisatoin rate by assuming what is known as the local
source approximation, that is by assuming that the photons emitted at
redshift $z$ are absorbed at the same redshift without propagation to
large distances.

In the local source approximation, Equation~(\ref{eqn:flux}) becomes
\begin{equation}
  j(\nu_0, z_0) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}(\nu_0, z_0)\epsilon(\nu_0, z_0),
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}$ is the mean free path.  The hydrogen
photoionization rate is given by
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma_\mathrm{HI}=4\pi\int_{\nu_{912}}^\infty d\nu \frac{j_\nu}{h\nu} \sigma(\nu),
  \label{eqn:gammapi}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the ionization cross-section
\begin{equation}
  \sigma(\nu) = \sigma_0\left(\frac{\nu}{\nu_{912}}\right)^{-3},
  \label{eqn:sigma}
\end{equation}
with $\sigma_0=6.3\times 10^{-18}$~cm$^2$ \citep{2006agna.book.....O}.
In the redshift range $z=2.3$--$5.5$, the mean free path is measured
to be \citep{2014MNRAS.445.1745W}
\begin{equation}
  \lambda_\mathrm{mfp}(\nu, z)= \lambda_0\left(\frac{1+z}{5}\right)^{-5.4}\left(\frac{\nu}{\nu_{912}}\right)^{1.5},
  \label{eqn:mfp}
\end{equation}
where the frequency dependence comes from the assumed column density
distribution $f(N_\mathrm{HI})\propto N_\mathrm{HI}^{-1.5}$.  We
extrapolate the redshift dependence in Equation~(\ref{eqn:mfp}) at
$z<2.3$ and $z>5.5$.  Combining Equations~(\ref{eqn:epsilon_freq}),
(\ref{eqn:sigma}), and (\ref{eqn:mfp}), Equation~(\ref{eqn:gammapi})
gives
\begin{multline}
  \Gamma_\mathrm{HI}=4.6\times 10^{-13} \mathrm{s}^{-1} \left(\frac{\epsilon_{912}}{10^{24}\mathrm{erg s^{-1} Hz^{-1} cMpc^{-3}}}\right)\\
  \times\left(\frac{1}{1.5-\alpha}\right)\left(\frac{1+z}{5}\right)^{-2.4}.
\end{multline}
Note that this equation refers to the \emph{comoving} emissivity.  The
local source approximation works well for $z>3$, as can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:gammapi}, where the points from the individual fits
are in much better agreement with the curves from the global model.
At lower redshift, the photoionisation rate in the individual models
is much higher than that in the global model, because the individual
models overestimate the flux at these redshifts.

\section{Hydrogen and helium reionization}

We now consider the implications for hydrogen and helium reionization
for the ionizing photon emissivity derived above.  This requires that
we extrapolate the emissivity of Equation XX to higher redshifts.
Unfortunately, the volume emissivity in our model cannot be
extrapolated to higher redshifts.  The model of Hopkins suffered with
the same problem.  \gk{Do we need to show two cases here?  One in
  which we extrapolate the emissivity and another in which we stop
  where data end.  There is perhaps a third possibility in which use
  the current emissivity model upto where data end.}  The evolution of
the volume averaged ionized fraction of hydrogen is given by
\citep{2012ApJ...746..125H}
\begin{equation}
{dQ_\nHII\over dt}={\dot n_{\rm ion}\over \langle n_\nH \rangle} -{Q_\nHII\over
\langle t_{\rm rec}\rangle},
\label{eq:qdot}
\end{equation}
and the corresponding equation doubly ionized Helium is
\begin{equation}
{dQ_\nHeIII\over dt}={\dot n_{\rm ion,4}\over \langle n_\nHe \rangle} -{Q_\nHeIII\over
\langle t_{\rm rec,He}\rangle}.
\label{eq:qHedot}
\end{equation}
We assume that the Helium is singly reionized together with hydrogen.
In order to get the 4~Ry emissivity of quasars we use the SED from
equation XX.  The recombination times are given by
\begin{equation}
\langle t_{\rm rec}\rangle=[\chi \langle n\rangle \alpha_B\,C]^{-1},
\label{eq:trec}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the volume averaged density of hydrogen and helium,
respectively.  We assume that hydrogen and helium have similar
clumping factors, given by \citep{2015ApJ...813L...8M}
\begin{equation}
  C = 2.8\left(\frac{1+z}{6}\right)^{-1.1}.
\end{equation}
For the helium recombination coeffienct, we use the fitting function
provided by \citet{1997MNRAS.292...27H}.  For hydrogen recombination
coefficient, we use the fitting function provided by
\citet{2011piim.book.....D}.

The resultant reionization histories of hydrogen and helium are shown
in Figure XX.  We also show the reionization histories from
\citep{2012ApJ...746..125H} and \citep{2015ApJ...813L...8M} for
comparison.  As expected from the emissivity result of the previous
section, quasars cannot single handedly reionize hydrogen.  However
they can reionise \HeII.  The Helium reionization completes at
redshift $z=3.5$--$3.7$ depending on the luminosity down to which you
integrate the quasar luminosity function.  This is consistent with the
Helium \lya opacity measurements of \citet{2016ApJ...825..144W}.

\section{Photon underproduction}

Our derivation of the LyC emissivity of AGN allows us to see if the
corresponding hydrogen photoionization rate is consistent with the
measured CDDF of the low-redshift ($z<0.5$) Ly$\alpha$ forest
\citep{2016ApJ...817..111D}.  \citet{2014ApJ...789L..32K} argued that
in order to match the CDDF observed by \citet{2016ApJ...817..111D} at
\gk{Define acronym CDDF.}  these redshifts, hydrodynamical
cosmological simulations require a hydrogen photoionization rate that
is a factor of five larger than that in the UV background (UVB) model
of \citet{2012ApJ...746..125H}.  \gk{This factor looks more than five
  in our plot!}  Several recent studies in the literature have
addressed this ``photon underproduction crisis''.  On the one hand,
these studies emphasised the uncertainty in the
\citet{2012ApJ...746..125H} UVB model at these redshifts due to the
lack of certainty in the UV photon emissivities of galaxies and AGN
\citep{2015MNRAS.451L..30K, 2015ApJ...811....3S}.  On the other hand,
they noted the uncertainty in the results of the cosmological
simulations at these redshifts, due to effects such as AGN feedback
and limited numerical resolution \citep{2015ApJ...811....3S,
  2017MNRAS.467L..86V, 2017MNRAS.471.1056N, 2017ApJ...837..106O,
  2017MNRAS.466..838G, 2017MNRAS.467.3172G, 2017ApJ...835..175G}.  A
general conclusion of these studies was that the discrepancy between
the photoionization rate required by the observed CDDF and predicted
by the UVB model of \citet{2012ApJ...746..125H} is likely to be
smaller than that found by \citet{2014ApJ...789L..32K}.  The
discrepancy is about a factor of 2 instead of 5.

The black curve in Figure~\ref{fig:puc} shows the evolution of the
hydrogen photoionization rate due to AGN in our best-fit global
luminosity function model.  (Yellow shaded region around the black
curve shows the small 68\% uncertainty.)  We find that the
photoionisation rate in our model due to AGN alone is higher than that
in the \citet{2012ApJ...746..125H} UVB model by a factor of 2.  This
higher photoionisation rate is consistent with that derived by
\citet{2015MNRAS.451L..30K} using the quasar luminosity function
measurements of \citet{2009MNRAS.392...19C} and
\citet{2013A&A...551A..29P}.  It is also consistent with the
photoionization rate found by \citet{2017MNRAS.467.3172G}, who found
that this photoionisation rate is sufficient to explain the CDDF
measured by \citet{2016ApJ...817..111D}.

\section{Conclusions}

We have presented an analysis of the evolution of the UV luminosity
function of AGN from redshift $z=0$ to $7.5$ using a combined
homogenised sample of close to 90,000 UV-selected AGN.  We only
consider quasars with spectroscopic redshifts and reliable
completeness estimates.  These data span magnitudes down to
$M_{1450}=-22$ at high redshifts ($z\gtrsim 3.5$).

\begin{itemize}
\item The AGN luminosity function prefers a double power law
  description at all redshift, except possibly at very high redshifts
  ($z\sim 6$) where only the faint-end of the luminosity function is
  observed.

\item The break magnitude $M_*$ of the double power law luminosity
  function shows a steep brightening towards the high redshift.  The
  break evolves from $M_*<-25$ at $z\sim 2$ to $M_*\sim -29$ at $z\sim
  6$.  Correspondingly, the amplitude $\phi_*$ of the luminosity
  function drops rapidly towards high redshifts from $\phi_*\sim
  10^{-6}$~mag$^{-1}$cMpc$^{-3}$ at $z\sim 2$ to $\phi_*<
  10^{-10}$~mag$^{-1}$cMpc$^{-3}$ at $z\sim 6$.  The break magnitude
  at $z=6$ is very bright, about $-30$, which is why the constraints
  on the bright end slope at these redshifts are weak.

\item The faint end slope $\beta$ of the luminosity function shows
  increased steepening at high redshifts, consistent with the findings
  of \citep{2015AA...578A..83G}.  The faint-end slope is $\beta\sim
  -1.8$ at $z\sim 2$ and steepens to $\beta\sim-2.5$ at $z\sim 6$.
  The bright-end slope $\alpha$ also shows moderate steepening towards
  high redshifts.  However, the constraints on $\alpha$ are weak,
  particularly at the high redshift because of the bright break
  luminosity.

\item A fourteen-parameter model accurately captures the redshift
  evolution of the luminosity function.  In this model, the evolution
  of the break magnitude $M_*$ is described by a cubic polynomial in
  $1+z$, while the evolution of the luminosity function amplitude
  follows a quadratic polynomial in $1+z$.  The evolution of the
  bright-end slope $\alpha$ evolves linearly in $1+z$.  The evolution
  of the faint-end slope $\beta$ is more complicated.  The faint-end
  slope stays roughly constant at lower redshifts $z<3$, steepens
  rapidly at $z\sim 3$--$4$, and then remains constant at higher
  redshifts.

\item An important finding of this work is that there are severe
  systematic errors in observed luminosity function.  We find that the
  most significant systematic bias is at redshift $z\sim 3$ in the
  BOSS sample of quasars.  There is also some evidence of a systematic
  bias in the lowest redshifts $z\lesssim 0.5$.  At $z<2.2$ there is
  some indication of a systematic error in completeness estimates at
  the faintest magnitudes $M_{1450}\sim -19$.  

\item In spite of the rapid steepening of the luminosity function at
  high redshifts, our derived LyC emissivity from AGN is quite low.
  This is because of the bright break luminosities, which results in a
  reduced contribution of intermediate brightness quasars to the Lyc
  emissivity as compared to some other determinations in the
  literature.  The LyC emissivity increases with time and peaks at
  $z\sim 2$.  At lower redshifts, the emissivity drops rapidly with
  time.  When our luminoisty function model is extrapolated and
  integrated down to $M_{1450}\sim -20$, the implied LyC emissivity is
  comparable to that in the model of \citet{2007ApJ...654..731H} and
  \citet{2012ApJ...746..125H}.  This indicates that hydrogen
  reionization is unlikely to have caused by AGN alone.

\item We derive photoionization rate by considering the HI column
  density distribution used by \citep{2012ApJ...746..125H}.  We find
  that the HI photoionization rate is significantly lower than that
  required by the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data at $z>2$.  Our hydrogen
  photoionization rate estimates are also considerably lower (by a
  factor of at least two) than that of \citet{2015AA...578A..83G}.  At
  the lowest redshifts, we find that the hydrogen photoionization rate
  is about a factor of two higher than the estimate of
  \citet{2007ApJ...654..731H} and \citet{2012ApJ...746..125H}.  When
  compared with the recent analysis of \citet{2017MNRAS.467.3172G},
  this photoionisation rate appears to allevaite the photon
  underproduction crisis.  Cite Kollmeier here.  
  
\item Helium reionization in our model occurs at redshift $z\sim
  3$ or $z=3.5$ if the luminosity function is integrated down to
  $M_{1450}=-20$ and $-18$, respectively.
  
\item Our analysis allows us to analyse the X-ray selected quasars of
  \citet{2015AA...578A..83G} in the larger context of UV-selected
  quasars.  We find that the the faint-end luminosity function
  measurements of \citet{2015AA...578A..83G} at $z=4$--$6$ are
  consitent with the measurements of the luminosity function at
  brighter luminosities.  Stil, our inferred value of the hydrogen
  ionizing luminosity density from quasars at these redshifts is much
  lower that the value derived by \citet{2015AA...578A..83G}.  This
  difference arises due to the difference in the data used in the two
  analyses at intermediate to bright luminosities.

\section{Comparison with Giallongo sample}
\label{sec:conv}

In our analysis above, we did not include the 22 low-luminosity
($M_{1450}>-22.6$) AGN between redshifts $z=4.1$ and $6.3$ reported by
\citet{2015AA...578A..83G} using a novel X-ray/NIR selection
criterion.  This was because we wanted to restrict our sample to
quasars that have robust spectroscopic redshift determinations.  In
their work, \citet{2015AA...578A..83G} found a steep faint-end of the
luminosity function at these redshifts.  With this luminosity function
they obtained a large value of hydrogen ionizing emissivity that could
explain the \lya data singlehandedly.  In this section, we compare our
results with \citet{2015AA...578A..83G}.  The black points in Figure
XX show the parameters of the double power law luminosity function
when the \citet{2015AA...578A..83G} sample is added to our analysis.
The parameter values do not change significantly.  The
\citet{2015AA...578A..83G} sample is thus consistent with the double
power law luminosity function preferred by other data at comparable
redshifts.  However, as we see in Figure XX, the total emissivity in
our model is still significantly lower than that obtained by
\citet{2015AA...578A..83G}.  Figure XX provides an explanation for
this. The double power law fits favoured by \citet{2015AA...578A..83G}
are quite different from our fits.  The character luminosity $M_*$
favoured by \citet{2015AA...578A..83G} is much fainter ($\sim -23$ at
$z = 5$) than that resulting out of our analysis ($\sim -29$ at $z =
5$).  Figure XX suggests that this is because of the SDSS Stripe 82
data \gk{citation} and because \citet{2015AA...578A..83G} ignore the
Kashikawa and Willott samples \gk{citation}.  It is possible that our
corrections to the Glikman data \gk{citation} also plays a role in
this.  In sum, the differnce in our emissivities is not due to lack of
faint quasars but because of the difference with Giallongo at
intermediate luminosities.
